gPRCity is a simple, easy-to-use, and advanced gRPC microservices library based on Node.js.

> The name is derived from "gRPC + City = gRPCity", symbolizing the author's hope that this library can support the development of business cities. Taking a technological perspective as the foundation, it enables everyone to focus on business and better support delivery. Here, I would like to recommend a game called "Cities: Skylines 2." It is a city simulation game that allows players to experience the excitement and challenges of creating and maintaining a real city firsthand.

### Code Hub

- GitHub: https://github.com/chakhsu/grpcity
- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/grpcity

### Target

Committed to providing a comprehensive Node.js-based, gRPC-based microservices development experience. Offering the Node.js community and developers an additional choice for microservices libraries with enhanced features.
Building two foundations: a microservices library technical foundation and a business support foundation.

### Principle

- **Focus**: Specialize in a gRPC microservices library, not a one-size-fits-all framework.
- **Simplicity**: Provide a simple and clear API that is easy to understand and quick to get started with.
- **Usability**: Simplify complex concepts as much as possible, offering clear and easy-to-follow code.
- **Stability**: High testability, extensive coverage, and a proven track record of reliability in online deployments.
- **Collaboration**: Leverage the Node.js community and ecosystem to the fullest extent.

### Features

- **API**: The communication protocol is based on gRPC and defined using Protobuf.
- **Protobuf**: Supports only dynamic loading of pb, simplifying the loading process of pb files.
- **Client**: Configured once and can be called anytime, anywhere, supporting multi-server invocation.
- **Server**: Simplifies the initialization process, starting the server in three steps, supporting multi-server startup.
- **No-Route**: No routing, RPC is inherently bound to methods.
- **Middleware**: Integrates middleware mechanism similar to Koa, providing pre and post-processing capabilities for RPC.
- **Metadata**: Standardizes the transmission and retrieval of metadata.
- **Error**: Provides dedicated Error objects to ensure targeted handling of exceptions after catching.
- **Promise**: Supports promisify internally in RPC methods while also preserving callbackify.
- **Config**: Aligned with official configurations, supports pb load configuration and gRPC channel configuration.
- **Pattern**: Singleton pattern ensures the uniqueness of instance objects.
- **Typescript**: Supported, ensuring compatibility between TS and JS.

...and a lot more.
