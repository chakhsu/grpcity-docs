# Get Started

We assume that you already have a basic understanding of gRPC, Node.js, and JavaScript.
The official documentation is the best teacher, and for a basic introduction to gRPC,
we recommend the following [link](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/tree/master/examples/helloworld/dynamic_codegen).

The quick start tutorial will be divided into three parts, ultimately guiding you
through the development of a complete microservices server using gRPCity and client-side invocation.

The project code corresponding to the introductory tutorial is already available on GitHub. [link](https://github.com/chakhsu/grpcity-basic-demo).
