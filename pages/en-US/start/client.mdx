# Client Side

Developing the client-side is relatively simpler. Here, you can see how to easily make calls to two different gRPC servers.

### Project Structure

```bash filename="Terminal" {13}
.
├── loader.js
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── proto
│   └── test
│       └── helloworld
│           ├── model
│           │   └── message.proto
│           └── service.proto
├── server.js
├── server2.js
└── client.js
```

We've already created `client.js` in the original project.

### Initialization

**Step 1**: Import the `loader.js` module, which we'll use in the subsequent development to bind methods with RPC and the server.

```js filename="./client.js"
import loader from "./loader.js"
```

**Step 2**: Initialize the client, passing in the server name and address.

```js filename="./client.js"
const start = async (server1Addr, server2Addr) => {
    await loader.init()

    await loader.initClients({
        services: {
            'test.helloworld.Greeter': server1Addr,
            'test.helloworld.Hellor': server2Addr
        }
    })
}
```

### Invocation and Start

We then add client-side logic for invoking the server and print the results in the `start` method.

After the `client` sends a request, the result received includes three values: `status`, `metadata`, and `response`.
- `status`: The server's state after execution.
- `metadata`: Metadata information sent by the client and returned by the server.
- `response`: The result returned by the server after processing.

```js filename="./client.js"
const start = async (server1Addr, server2Addr) {

    // ...
    // Loader init code
    // ....

    // Server1
    // Greeter client
    const server1Client = loader.client('test.helloworld.Greeter')
    const greetResult = await server1Client.sayGreet({ name: 'greeter' })
    console.log('server1Client.sayGreet', greetResult.response)

    // Server2
    // Hellor client
    const server2Client = loader.client('test.helloworld.Hellor')
    const hellorResult = await server2Client.sayHello({ name: 'hellor' })
    console.log('server2Client.sayHello', hellorResult.response)
}

// Execute
start('127.0.0.1:9098', '127.0.0.1:9099')
```

### Testing

In the previous server-side tutorial, we've already started two servers. So, executing the client is all that's needed to complete integration testing.

```bash filename="Terminal"
node ./client.js
```

The results of the first execution are as follows:

```bash filename="Terminal"
server1Client.sayGreet { message: 'hello greeter by Greeter in server1', count: 1 }
server2Client.sayHello { message: 'hello hellor by Hellor in server2' }
```

The results of the second execution are as follows:

```bash filename="Terminal"
server1Client.sayGreet { message: 'hello greeter by Greeter in server1', count: 2 }
server2Client.sayHello { message: 'hello hellor by Hellor in server2' }
```

We can see that both executions return results as expected, and the `count` in the `sayGreet` method accumulates to 2 after the second execution, indicating the successful completion of this client-to-server interaction loop.

The introductory tutorial is now complete, and it should feel quite simple and user-friendly. Feel free to revisit and further your learning.
