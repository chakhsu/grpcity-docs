# Server

Server is one of the core features of `gRPCity`, providing the ability to take over the server-side lifecycle. Through a series of interface functions, it offers full-cycle management APIs for tasks such as certificate import, service binding, middleware support, server startup, and server shutdown.

### Initialization

```js
// Get the server instance
const server = await loader.initServer(serverOptions)
```

`serverOptions` is an object that includes the following parameters:
- `channelOptions`: Optional, communication configuration rules;
- `credentials`: Optional, server-side certificate;

<Callout>
Detailed explanations of `channelOptions` can be found in the [Config Guide](/en/docs/guide/config).
</Callout>

<Callout>
Detailed explanations of `credentials` can be found in the [Credentials Guide](/en/docs/guide/credentials).
</Callout>

### Service Binding

```js
// Service RPC binding
server.add(name, implementation, options)
```

Parameter explanations:
- `name`: (Required) Specifies the route in the `proto` file, specifically to the location of the `service`;
- `implementation`: (Required) An object or class carrying methods defined in the service RPC;
- `options`: (Optional) Object:
    - `exclude`: (Optional) Array of strings, excluding methods in `implementation` that do not need to be involved in `service RPC` binding;
    - `inherit`: (Optional) If `implementation` obtains `func` through inheritance, and the parent class should also be involved in binding, pass the parent class to this parameter;

### Service Remove

```js
// Service RPC unbinding
server.remove(name)
```

Parameter explanation:
- `name`: (Required) Specifies the route in the `proto` file, specifically to the location of the `service`;

### Middleware

`server.use()` provides middleware capabilities for pre and post-processing of `implementation`. For more details, see the [Middleware Guide](/en/docs/advanced/server-middleware).

```js
// Middleware support for implementation
// Add one by one
server.use(f1)
server.use(f2)
server.use(f3)
// Add with multiple parameters
server.use(f1, f2, f3)
// Add using an array
server.use([f1, f2, f3])
```

<Callout type="warning">
Note: Only `async` methods are supported for middleware in the current version; `callback` is not supported yet.
</Callout>

### Certificates and Startup

The `listen` method for server startup supports two parameters: `addr` and `credentials`:

- `addr`: (Required) The address and port that the service startup needs to listen to, supporting either of the following types:
    - string: in the format of ip+port, such as `127.0.0.1:9099`;
    - object: `{ host, port }`;
        - host: string, supports both ip and domain names;
        - port: number, with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 65535;
- `credentials`: (Optional) Generated using `loader.makeServerCredentials()` and passed to the `listen` call;

```js
// Server certificate
const credentials = server.makeServerCredentials(rootCerts, keyCertPairs, checkClientCertificate)
// Server startup
await server.listen(addr, credentials)
// or
// await server.listen('127.0.0.1:9099', credentials)
// await server.listen({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 9099 }, credentials)
```

<Callout type="warning">
Priority of `credentials`: Highest in `listen()`, followed by `initServer()`, and finally the default.
</Callout>

### Server Shutdown

`shutdown()` needs to use `async` to ensure asynchronous execution completion, while `forceShutdown` does not.

```js
// Graceful server shutdown
await server.shutdown()
// Forceful server shutdown
server.forceShutdown()
```
