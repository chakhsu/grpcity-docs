# Server Middleware

`gRPCity` provides a middleware mechanism for server-side processing, allowing us to run middleware code before and after the execution of rpc. The difference between server-side middleware and client-side middleware lies in the context.

In various business scenarios such as unified call log printing, monitoring metric collection, authentication, parameter modification, result modification, delay, and retry, middleware plays a very convenient role, enhancing the development efficiency of handling business.

### Principle

The middleware implementation of `gRPCity` is based on the onion model, making it easy for us to execute middleware.

Suppose we have three middleware functions, a, b, and c, and the execution order is `a → b → c`, as shown below:

```
enter a
  enter b
    enter c
      rpc-method()
    exit  c
  exit  b
exit  a
```

### Usage

`gRPCity server` provides the `server.use()` method for adding middleware.

<Callout type="warning">
The current version only supports middleware for `async unary` and `async stream` methods, and `stream` and `callback` are not yet supported.
</Callout>

Usage:

```js
const server = await loader.initServer()

// Add one by one
server.use(f1)
server.use(f2)
server.use(f3)

// Add with multiple parameters
server.use(f1, f2, f3)

// Add using an array
server.use([f1, f2, f3])
```

The placement of adding middleware is after `initServer()` and before `listen()`.

### Context

```js
const middleware = async (ctx, next) => {
  console.log(ctx)
  await next()
  console.log(ctx)
}
```

The first printed context shows information such as `path`, `method`, `request`, `metadata`, and `peer`, which are obtained before server processing and can be modified. The `method` includes the type of call, and the `metadata` and `options` parameters of the request.

```bash filename="Terminal"
{
  path: '/helloworld.Greeter/SayGreet',
  method: {
    requestStream: false,
    responseStream: false
  },
  request: { name: 'greeter' },
  metadata: Metadata {
    internalRepr: Map(3) {
      'x-client-hostname' => [Array],
      'x-service-path' => [Array],
      'user-agent' => [Array]
    },
    options: {}
  },
  peer: '127.0.0.1:64929'
}
```

The second printed context, in addition to `response`, is added after execution and can be modified. The final response is based on the modified result.

```bash filename="Terminal" {17}
{
  path: '/helloworld.Greeter/SayGreet',
  method: {
    requestStream: false,
    responseStream: false
  },
  request: { name: 'greeter' },
  metadata: Metadata {
    internalRepr: Map(3) {
      'x-client-hostname' => [Array],
      'x-service-path' => [Array],
      'user-agent' => [Array]
    },
    options: {}
  },
  peer: '127.0.0.1:64929',
  response: { message: 'hello greeter by Greeter', count: 1 }
}
```

### Example

```js filename="log.js"
const log = async (ctx, next) => {
  const startTime = Date.now()
  await next()
  const responseTimeMs = Date.now() - startTime

  console.log({
      path: ctx.path,
      peer: ctx.peer,
      request: ctx.request,
      responseTimeMs
  })
}

export default log
```

Add middleware:

```js filename="server.js"
import log from './log.js'

// other...

server.use(log)
```

With this, we have completed the writing and usage of server-side middleware.
