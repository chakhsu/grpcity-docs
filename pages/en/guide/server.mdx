# Server

The Server is one of the core features of `gRPCity`, providing the ability to manage the server lifecycle.
It offers a range of interface functions for managing the entire lifecycle, from importing certificates, binding services, supporting middleware, starting services, and shutting down services.

### Server Instance

`channelOptions` are explained in detail in the [Config guide](/en/guide/config).

```javascript
// Get a server instance
const server = loader.initServer(channelOptions)
```

Once you have the `server` instance, it offers a series of interfaces to help you develop services.

### Service Binding

Service binding requires three parameters: `service`, `implementation` and `options`.

- `name`: (required) specifies the routing of the `proto` file, which is the location of the `service`;
- `implementation`: (required) An object or class with the methods defined by the service rpc.
- `options`: (optional) an object:
    - `exclude`: (optional) an array of strings, excluding methods in `implementation` that do not need to participate in `service rpc` binding;
    - `inherit`: (optional) if `implementation` is obtained through inheritance and the inherited methods should also be bound to `service rpc`, the inherited object needs to be passed as well;

```javascript
// Bind service RPC
server.addService(name, implementation, options)
// Unbind service RPC
server.removeService(name)
```

### Adding Middleware

A distinctive feature of `gRPCity` Server is that it provides middleware capabilities for pre- and post-processing of `implementation`. For more details, see the [Middleware guide](/en/guide/middleware).

Note: Only service RPCs bound using `loader.callbackify()` support middleware.

```javascript
// Middleware support for implementation
server.addMiddleware(fn)
server.addMiddlewares(fns)
```

### Certificates and Startup

To start the service, the `listen` function supports two parameters: `addr` and `credentials`:

- `addr`: (required) The address and port on which the service needs to listen. You can provide either of the following, either as a string or as an object (choose one):
    - string: in the format `ip+port`, such as `127.0.0.1:9099`;
    - object: `{ host, port }`:
        - host: a string, supports both IP addresses and domain names;
        - port: a number, with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 65535;
- `credentials`: (optional) Generated using `makeServerCredentials` and provided to the `listen` call.

```javascript
// Server credentials
const credentials = server.makeServerCredentials(rootCerts, keyCertPairs, checkClientCertificate)
// Start the service
await server.listen(addr, credentials)
// await server.listen('127.0.0.1:9099', credentials)
// await server.listen({ host: '127.0.0.1', port: 9099 }, credentials)
```

For more information, you can read the [Credentials guide](/en/guide/credentials).

### Service Shutdown

Use `shutdown()` with `async` to ensure that it completes asynchronously, while `forceShutdown` doesn't require `async`.

```javascript
// Graceful service shutdown
await server.shutdown()
// Forceful service shutdown
server.forceShutdown()
```
