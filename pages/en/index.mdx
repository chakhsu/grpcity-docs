gPRCity is a simple, easy-to-use, and advanced gRPC microservices library based on Node.js.

### What is it?

`gRPCity` is a gRPC microservices library running on Node.js. It combines `proto-loader` and `grpc-js` to offer an exceptionally easy way to load proto files. It simplifies many complex technical concepts, allowing clients and servers to be implemented with just a few functions. Additionally, it provides numerous advanced features to meet the needs of most development scenarios.

> The name is derived from "gRPC + City = gRPCity", symbolizing the author's hope that this library can support the development of business cities. Taking a technological perspective as the foundation, it enables everyone to focus on business and better support delivery.

### Origin

The first line of code for `gRPCity` was initially written on October 28, 2019, with contributions from [Kamuel](https://github.com/k7) introducing the capabilities of `proto load` and `client proxy`. This portion of the code corresponds to version `0.5`.
Following version `0.5`, [Chakhsu](https://github.com/chakhsu) continued to enhance the functionality, progressively adding support for `multi proto load`, `full client proxy`, `server call proxy`, and `full stream support`, gradually making the library feature-complete.
Currently, the library has been deployed in production, with instances using the library numbering in the hundreds. Feel free to give it a try!

### Desgin

The intrinsic execution design of `gRPCity` is very clear, as shown below.

`.proto` -> `this._packagePrefix` -> `this._types`:

`init clients` -> `get client` -> `client proxy` -> `rpc method call` -> `do`:

`init server` -> `instance` -> `call proxy`:

### Principle

- **Focus**: Specialize in a gRPC microservices library, not a one-size-fits-all framework.
- **Simplicity**: Provide a simple and clear API that is easy to understand and quick to get started with.
- **Usability**: Simplify complex concepts as much as possible, offering clear and easy-to-follow code.
- **Stability**: High testability, extensive coverage, and a proven track record of reliability in online deployments.
- **Collaboration**: Leverage the Node.js community and ecosystem to the fullest extent.

### Features

- **API**: The communication protocol is based on gRPC and defined using Protobuf.
- **Protobuf**: Supports only dynamic loading of pb, simplifying the loading process of pb files.
- **Client**: Configured once and can be called anytime, anywhere, supporting multi-server invocation.
- **Server**: Simplifies the initialization process, starting the server in three steps, supporting multi-server startup.
- **No-Route**: No routing, RPC is inherently bound to methods.
- **Middleware**: Integrates middleware mechanism similar to Koa, providing pre and post-processing capabilities for RPC.
- **Metadata**: Standardizes the transmission and retrieval of metadata.
- **Error**: Provides dedicated Error objects to ensure targeted handling of exceptions after catching.
- **Promise**: Supports promisify internally in RPC methods while also preserving callbackify.
- **Config**: Aligned with official configurations, supports pb load configuration and gRPC channel configuration.
- **Pattern**: Singleton pattern ensures the uniqueness of instance objects.
- **Typescript**: Supported, ensuring compatibility between TS and JS.

...and a lot more.
