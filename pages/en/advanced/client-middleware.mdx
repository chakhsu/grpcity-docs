# Client Middleware

`gRPCity` provides a middleware mechanism for client-side calls, allowing us to execute middleware code before and after the RPC.

In various business scenarios such as unified call log printing, monitoring metric collection, authentication, parameter modification, result modification, delay, and retry, middleware plays a very convenient role, enabling us to improve development efficiency in handling business.

### Principles

The implementation of `gRPCity`'s middleware is based on the onion model, making it easy for us to execute middleware.

Suppose we have three middleware functions, a, b, and c. The order of middleware execution is `a → b → c`, as shown below:

```
enter a
  enter b
    enter c
      rpc-method()
    exit  c
  exit  b
exit  a
```

### Usage

`gRPCity Client` provides the `clients.use()` method to add middleware.

<Callout type="warning">
The current version only supports middleware for `async unary` and `async stream` methods; `stream` and `callback` are not yet supported.
</Callout>

Usage is as follows:

```js
const clients = await loader.initClients()

// Add one by one
clients.use(f1)
clients.use(f2)
clients.use(f3)

// Add with multiple parameters
clients.use(f1, f2, f3)

// Add using an array
clients.use([f1, f2, f3])
```

### Context

```js
const middleware = async (ctx, next) => {
  console.log(ctx)
  await next()
  console.log(ctx)
}
```

The first printed context includes `path`, `method`, and `request`, which are added before calling the server and can be modified. The `method` includes the type of call and the `metadata` and `options` parameters of the request.

```bash filename="Terminal"
{
  path: '/helloworld.Greeter/SayGreet',
  method: {
    requestStream: false,
    responseStream: false,
    metadata: Metadata { internalRepr: [Map], options: {} },
    options: { deadline: 2024-01-16T16:22:11.836Z }
  },
  request: { name: 'greeter' }
}
```

The second printed context adds `peer`, `status`, `metadata`, and `response`, which are added after execution and can be modified. The final response is based on the modified result.

```bash filename="Terminal"
{
  path: '/helloworld.Greeter/SayGreet',
  method: {
    requestStream: false,
    responseStream: false,
    metadata: Metadata { internalRepr: [Map], options: {} },
    options: { deadline: 2024-01-16T16:22:11.836Z }
  },
  request: { name: 'greeter' },
  metadata: Metadata {
    internalRepr: Map(9) {
      'content-type' => [Array],
      'x-cache-control' => [Array],
      'x-business-id' => [Array],
      'x-timestamp-client' => [Array],
      'x-client-hostname' => [Array],
      'x-service-path' => [Array],
      'user-agent' => [Array],
      'x-timestamp-server' => [Array],
      'date' => [Array]
    },
    options: {}
  },
  response: { message: 'hello, greeter' },
  status: {
    code: 0,
    details: 'OK',
    metadata: Metadata { internalRepr: Map(0) {}, options: {} }
  },
  peer: '::1:9099'
}
```

### Example

Using call log printing as an example:

```js filename="log.js"
const log = async (ctx, next) => {
    const startTime = Date.now()
    await next()
    const responseTimeMs = Date.now() - startTime

    console.log({
        path: ctx.path,
        peer: ctx.peer,
        responseTimeMs
    })
  }
}

export default log
```

Adding middleware:

```js filename="client.js"
import log from './log.js'

// other...

clients.use(log)
```

With this, we have completed the writing and usage of client-side middleware.
