# Middleware

Middleware is an essential feature in `gRPCity`, providing the ability to execute middleware code before and after handling RPC calls.
Middleware plays a convenient role in scenarios such as uniform call logging, monitoring metric collection, authentication, parameter modification, result modification, and delay.
This helps improve development efficiency in handling business logic.

The middleware implementation in `gRPCity` is based on the `koa-compose` library, which provides an onion model working mechanism for executing middleware.

Suppose we have three middleware functions: A, B, and C. The order in which middleware is executed is `A -> B -> C`. Here's how it works:

```
enter A
  enter B
    enter C
      rpc-method()
    exit C
  exit B
exit A
```

### Usage

`gRPCity` server provides two methods to support middleware: `server.addMiddleware(fn)` and `server.addMiddlewares(fns)`.

The difference between the two methods is that one can only pass a single middleware, while the other can accept multiple middlewares, as follows:

```js
server.addMiddleware(a)
server.addMiddleware(b)
server.addMiddleware(c)
// Equivalent to
server.addMiddleware([a, b, c])
```

You can add middleware after initializing the server with `initServer()` and before calling `listen()`.

### Writing Middleware

Here, we will demonstrate how to write middleware for logging RPC calls.

Middleware functions support two parameters: `ctx` and `next`, as follows:
- `ctx`: An object that represents the middleware context.
  - `path`: The RPC route path.
  - `request`: The RPC request parameters.
  - `metadata`: Metadata from the client.
  - `response`: The result returned by the RPC method, which is available only after the RPC method is executed.
- `next`: A function that executes the next middleware or the actual method.

```javascript
class Log {
  async middleware(ctx, next) {
    const startTime = Date.now()
    await next()
    const responseTimeMs = Date.now() - startTime

    console.log({
        path: ctx.path,
        request: ctx.request,
        responseTimeMs
    })
  }
}

export default new Log()
```

To add the middleware:

```javascript
import log from './log.js'

server.addMiddleware(log.middleware)
```

With these steps, you have completed writing and using middleware.
